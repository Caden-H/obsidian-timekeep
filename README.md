This plugin provides a way to simply and easily track time spent on various tasks. After tracking your time you can export the tracked time as a **Markdown Table**, **CSV**, **JSON**, or **PDF**

This plugin provides a command for inserting time trackers `Timekeep: Insert Tracker` alternatively a timekeep can be created by creating a codeblock like the following:

````
```timekeep

```
````

## Editing & Deleting

If you accidentally gave a block an incorrect name or started the timer late you can use the editing feature to update the stored data or delete the entry

## ðŸ‘€ How its stored

This plugin is heavily inspired by [ObsidianSimpleTimeTracker](https://github.com/Ellpeck/ObsidianSimpleTimeTracker) (Semi backwards compatible some simple-time-tracker blocks can be renamed to timekeep) so the data for time tracking is stored as JSON within the `timekeep` codeblock.

The time block start and stop times are stored as timestamps, this makes it possible for you to start your time tracker then close Obsidian and have the tracking still continuing when you open it again.

## Formats

Below are the various formats that timekeeping data can be exported to

### Markdown Table
